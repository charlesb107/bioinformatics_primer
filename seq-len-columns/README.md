# Strings: Find and Format Sequence Lengths

Change this to process short sequences.

Create a Python program called `column.py` that takes a list of words and creates a columnar output of each word and their length. If given no words as positional, command-line arguments, print a usage statement. For the output, first print a header of "word" and "len", then lines which are the width of the longest word and the longest numbers with a minimum for each of the column headers themselves. The words should be left-justified in the first column and the numbers should be right-justified in the second column.
