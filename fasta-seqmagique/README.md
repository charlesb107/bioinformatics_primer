# FASTA Summary With Seqmagique

Now let's finally get into parsing good, old FASTA files.  We're going to need to install the BioPython (http://biopython.org/) module to get a FASTA parser.  This should work for you:

````
$ python3 -m pip install biopython
````

For this exercise, I'll use a few reads from the Global Ocean Sampling Expedition (https://imicrobe.us/#/samples/578). You can download the full file with this command:

````
$ iget /iplant/home/shared/imicrobe/projects/26/samples/578/CAM_SMPL_GS108.fa
````

Since that file is 725M, I've added a sample to the repo in the `examples` directory.

````

The format of a FASTA file is:

* A record starts with a header row which has `>` as the first character on a line
* The string following the `>` up until the first whitespace is the record ID
* Anything following the ID up to the newline can be the "description," but here we see this space has been set up as key/value pairs of metadata
* Any line after a header that does not start with `>` is the sequence. The sequence may be one long line or many shorter lines.

We **could** write our own FASTA parser, and we would definitely learn much along the way, but let's not and instead use the BioPython `SeqIO` (sequence input-output) module to read and write all the different formats. FASTA is one of the most common, but other formats may include FASTQ (FASTA but with "Quality" scores for the base calls), GenBank, EMBL, and more. See https://biopython.org/wiki/SeqIO for an exhaustive list. 

There is a useful program called `seqmagick` that will give you information like the following:

````
$ seqmagick info *.fa
name              alignment    min_len   max_len   avg_len  num_seqs
CAM_SMPL_GS108.fa FALSE             47       594    369.65       499
CAM_SMPL_GS112.fa FALSE             50       624    383.50       500
````

You can install it like so:

````
$ python -m pip install seqmagick
````

Let's write a toy program to mimic part of the output. We'll skip the "alignment" and just do min/max/avg lengths, and the number of sequences.  You can pretty much copy and paste the example code from http://biopython.org/wiki/SeqIO. Here is the output from our script, `seqmagique.py`:

````
$ ./seqmagique.py *.fa
name              min_len    max_len    avg_len    num_seqs
CAM_SMPL_GS108.fa         47        594 369.45            500
CAM_SMPL_GS112.fa         50        624 383.50            500
````

The code to produce this builds on our earlier skills of lists and dictionaries as we will parse each file and save a dictionary of stats into a list, then we will iterate over that list at the end to show the output.
