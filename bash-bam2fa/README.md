# Bash: Convert BAM to FASTA (bam2fa)

Building on the `parallel` chapter, here is an example of converting BAM files to FASTA. SAM and BAM are formats for storing sequence alignments and stand for "Sequence Alignment Map" which is plain text and "Binary Alignment Map" which is the same information but stored in a compressed format only readable by machines. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAM_(file_format)

It's common to get SAM/BAM formats from a sequencing core as your sequences are often aligned to some reference like human. You can use `samtools` to look at the files and convert them to other formats easily enough. This program is designed to quickly convert a directory of BAM files into FASTA files that will live in some new directory.

## Checking and unpacking arguments

After using `set -u` to catch basic mistakes, we check `$#` to see how many arguments we have (mnemonic: `#` is the symbol for "number"). We need at least one argument but no more than 3. Print a usage if needed. Then we put `$1`, `$2`, etc. into judiciously named variables that describe what they are. Too often I see programs where `$1` is used throughout; while valid, this makes the code unreadable whereas `$IN_DIR` reminds me what the variable is supposed to be.

## Testing directories

The test `-d $IN_DIR` will be "True" if the string in `$IN_DIR` names a directory that exists. (Use `man test` to see other tests you can use.) We use `!` to negate it, meaning there is no directory with that name. If this is the case, we report the error and `exit 1`. It's very important to `exit` with a *non-zero exit code* when there is an error. If you are using `make` or `parallel` or other programs to chain this, you can ensure the chain will fail if a component fails. *This is wise and good.* You do not want to complete an analysis pipeline if some key step fails. You want to report errors and halt processing until the error is fixed!

Likewise with testing `$IN_DIR`, we test if `$OUT_DIR` exists and create it with `mkdir -p` if it does not. The `-p` option tells `mkdir` to create "parent" directories as needed. If the user wanted the output files to go into `$HOME/projects/foo/bar/fasta`, `mkdir` would fail if all the directories up to `fasta` didn't exist. With `-p` it will create any needed parent directories.

## Finding input files

Next I want to `find` inside `$IN_DIR` any files with a `-name` ending with `.bam` that are greater in `-size` than 0 characters/. I put these into a temporary file so I can count them and later iterate over them. I do not like using the `bash` syntax for lists, so I always put lists of things into files. I find the number of lines in the file using `wc -l` and see if `$NUM` is less than (`-lt`) one. If so, I alert the user and `exit 1` to indicate an error.

## Temporary files

I prefer to use `mktemp` to get a temporary file. You could just overwrite a statically named `files.txt` file if you want, but you run the risk of accidentally overwriting a jobs file that is still being used by another process. It's much safer to use `mktemp` as it guarantees a uniquely named file in a temporary directory. Additionally, if you forget to `rm` the file when you are done, it will likely be created in a location where old, unused files are regularly removed by the system.

## Create jobs file

I make a second temp file for the commands that need to be run, one for each file. I use `while read` to read each line from the `$FILES` into a variable called `BAM` that is the name of the BAM file. I like to print out "1: foo.bam", "2: bar.bam", etc., while processing so I can see what is happening and how many files are being processed, so I increment a counter `$i` by one and use `printf` to print out the counter as three-characters-wide digit (`%3d`), followed by a colon (`:`), followed by a string (`%s`) where I'll show the `basename` of the file where:

````
$ basename foo/bar/baz.bam
baz.bam
````

I want to use the basename of the file as the new filename but with the `.bam` extension removed which I can note as the optional second argument to `basename`:

````
$ basename foo/bar/baz.bam ".bam"
baz
````

I create the name of the new `FASTA` file by creating a new string `$OUT_DIR/$BASE.fa`. I use the test `! -f` to check if the file *does not exist*; if so, I `echo` the `samtools` command to convert it to `fasta` format, redirecting with the single `>` to put the output from `samtools` into the new `$FASTA` file. This whole command gets *appended* with the double `>>` into the `$JOBS` file. (I've have used a single `>` in that instance more times than I care to admit, which means that I will only run the last job because the single `>` *overwrites* any existing content!)

## Running the jobs file

I look for the `parallel` command using `which` to inspect my `$PATH` for any program with this name. If you have installed `parallel` on your system but this fails, it's probably because `parallel` exists in some location that is not in your `$PATH`. You can fix this by putting `parallel` into one of the directories in your `$PATH` or by appending the directory location into your existing `$PATH`. You could modify this script like so:

````
PATH=/directory/with/parallel:$PATH
````

Be sure it's the *directory* where `parallel` lives, not the `parallel` program itself.

The `-z` test checks if a string is null which will be the case if `parallel` is not found. In that case, we execute all the commands with `sh`; otherwise, we run `parallel` with some number of cores, noting that any failures should `halt` the process.

## Cleaning up

Finally we remove (`rm`) our temporary files and say good-bye to the user. I always `echo "Done."` at the end of my `bash` programs just so I can see that I made it to the end of the program.
