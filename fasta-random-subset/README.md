# Randomly Subset a FASTA file

Here is a version that will randomly select some percentage of the reads from the input file. I had to write this version because we had created an artificial metagenome from a set of known organisms, and I was testing a program with input of various numbers of reads. I did not realize at first that, in creating the artificial set, reads from each organism had been added in blocks. Since I was taking all my reads from the top of the file down, I was mostly getting just the first few species. Randomly selecting reads when there are potentially millions of records is a bit tricky, so I decided to use a non-deterministic approach where I just roll the dice and see if the number I get on each read is less than the percentage of reads I want to take. This program will also stop at a given number of reads so you could use it to randomly subset an unevenly sized number of samples down to the same number of reads per sample.
